# block-shooter-game

A simple bullet-hell game written in TypeScript with webpack. 
The game aspect is still very much in it's early stages and is mainly an idea field now.

The first edition of this game, has written in purely ES5 functions and employed a simple 
load/update/render OO paradigm. The current edition uses an Entity-Component-System architecture 
as an framework to implement the game.
